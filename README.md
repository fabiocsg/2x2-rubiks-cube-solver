### 2x2 Rubik's Cube Solver

Small project where I tried to use reinforcement learning (Q-learning) to train an agent to solve a 2x2 Rubik's Cube.\
The goal was to have the agent learn the optimal moves to solve the cube from different scrambled states.


##### How It Works

1. The `Agent` class learns to solve the cube by building a Q-table over several training episodes. The Q-table stores the best actions for different cube states.

2. After training, the `Solver` tries to solve the cube from various shuffled configurations (1 to 10 shuffles), using the Q-table generated by the Agent.
